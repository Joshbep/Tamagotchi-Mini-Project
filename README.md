# Firegotchi-Mini-Project

## Description
<div>
Welcome to my first mini project! It's the first thing I've done that I've used all I've learned at General Assembly. This entire project was a learning process as it is the first time I've utilized all javascript, HTML, and CSS to build something from the ground up.
<br>
I was able to apply all the conecepts i've learned so far and utilized simple DOM manipulation and object-oriented programming. I was also able to learn new "micro" concepts like using intervals and manipulating CSS through JavaScript to change overall functionality.
<br><br>
If you check it out, let me know If you have any feedback. It would help further my journey!
