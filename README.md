# Firegotchi-Mini-Project
## Description
<div>
Welcome to my first mini project! This is the first project that I've utilized all I've learned JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
The process was definitely trial-by-fire as it is the first time I've utilized all three programming languages to build something from the ground up.
<br>
I was able to apply all the conecepts i've learned so far and utilized simple DOM manipulation and object-oriented programming. I was also able to learn new "micro" concepts like using intervals and manipulating CSS through JavaScript to change overall functionality.
<br><br>
Thanks for taking a look! If you have any feedback, it would be more than appreciated through this learning process.
